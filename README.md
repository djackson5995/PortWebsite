   - Displays my profile picture and a brief introduction.
   - Provides my contact information, including my phone number, email, and location.
   - Outlines my educational journey, from my current Full Stack Bootcamp to previous academic achievements.

2. **💼 Right Side (Main Content Area)**:
   - Includes a welcoming section with a brief bio about myself and my role as a Full Stack Developer.
   - Contains a dedicated section for showcasing projects I have worked on.

## 🌟 Key Features

## 📜 Code Explanation

### 📂 HTML Structure

The HTML file is organized using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<div>`, providing a clean and structured layout. Key components include:

- **Header**: Contains a logo and navigation menu for easy access to different sections.
- **Left Side (Sidebar)**: Features my profile picture, introduction, contact info, and education history.
- **Right Side (Main Content Area)**: Houses sections for personal introduction and project highlights.

### 🎨 CSS Styling

The styling is managed through an external CSS file (`Styles.css`), which sets the overall look and feel of the site.

- **🧰 Flexbox Layout**: Utilizes Flexbox for a responsive layout, ensuring both the sidebar and main content adjust gracefully across devices.
- **🌐 Font Awesome Icons**: Uses Font Awesome icons to add visual appeal to contact information.
- **📋 Custom Fonts and Images**: Incorporates custom fonts via Google Fonts and personalized images to enhance the aesthetic.
